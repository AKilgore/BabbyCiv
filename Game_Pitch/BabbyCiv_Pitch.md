Aislynn's Babby Civ Pitch:

Turn-based Strategy Game:
(This might be way too difficult and I'll probably end up making a platformer).

2 Players:
	- Each player has one city.
	- Player One takes the first turn.

3 Units (1 melee, 1 ranged, 1 siege):
	- Each of the units have different stats and time that it takes to create them 	(production speed).
	- Stats: Movement speed, damage against units, damage against cities, health.

4 Technologies/Upgrades:
	- One upgrade for each of the types of units and then one upgrade for the city.
	- Upgrade for units improves unit damage and production speed.
	- Upgrade for city improves city health.
	- WE HAVE decided whether or not units and upgrades can be built at the same time, but they probably won't be able to.
	
Menus:
	- Need a menu for unit production.
	- Menu for Upgrade production.
	- Menu for attacking/defending.
	- Menu screen for game ending/starting/replay

Map:
	- Small maps (might choose randomly from 3 pre-made maps at the start of the game)
	- Made up of Field, Forest and Mountain tiles.
	- Field tiles have no movement penalty.
	- Forest tiles make units move 50% slower.
	- Mountain tiles are impassable.
