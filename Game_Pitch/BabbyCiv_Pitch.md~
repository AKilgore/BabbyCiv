Game Ideas

--------------------------
## Babby* Civ:
A very small historical turn based strategy with just a few units, buildings, resources and (maybe) technologies (any of these elements can be cut for the sake of simplicity). 
*Misspelled on purpose

## Genre:
A turn-based strategy game like the Civilization or Victoria series.

## Technical Hurdles:
Creating stats for units, buildings and technologies.
Randomly generated maps and starting positions.
Some sort of UI or menu bar.
Making it 2 player or making a computer player.

-------------------------
## Cat Sim (a.k.a. I really want a cat but I don’t want it taken away by housing):
Keep a kitty alive and happy.

## Genre:
Like that Catz game from the late 1990s (they’ve made newer ones, but it won’t be like those).

## Technical Hurdles:
Creating a cat with requirements for what it needs to live.
Items for the cat to interact with.
Some sort of UI or menu bar.

---------------------------
## Steampunk Platformer from the Future of the Past!:
What the title says, it’ll probably be ridiculous.

## Genre:
Side-scrolling platform game.

## Technical Hurdles:
Creating and controlling the character.
Constructing platformer levels.
Different types of enemies and how to get rid of them.
Different items/weapons for character to use.
